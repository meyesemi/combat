@W: MT529 :"c:\users\gowin\desktop\ceshi\ethernet_g\ethernet_g\src\gbit_phy_test_rgmii.v":151:0:151:5|Found inferred clock Gbit_PHY_test_RGMII|I_phy1_rxc which controls 20 sequential elements including test_d[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
